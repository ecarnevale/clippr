Pictures?

A thought from Aaron that would be nice: how about "export a year of clippings". Ie: date-bounded export. Would be nice. (export flat site; export flat site limited by range)
search?

admin page - to clear db, mainly.

Colon issue: why does that last Quicksilver one not work? Write a TEST YOU MORON.

Instapaper:

  should be pre-loaded in the db
  InstapaperReference objects can be joined to clippings - these reference the
    original article
  UI to magically, ajaxwise, guess the original article
  API key for the new google search api.
